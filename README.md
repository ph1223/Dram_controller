# Dependencies
- clone this folder to a linux environment, I suggest using WSL(Window Subsystem For Linux)

- chmod +x install_tools.sh then run this shell script which installs the following tools and dependencies clangd, cmake, make, gnu, gdb, python3

# Folder structures
- Memory Controller -> Memory_Controllers has the RTL design of the project Bank Level Controller, DRAM_Controller is the final version with Global Controller and baackend Controller connected to form a workable DRAM system for the interaction with the frontend Core.
- cacti, the 3D-DRAM Modeling tool for timing constraints and Power extraction of the target 3D-DRAM
- Ramulator2, Architectural Simulator for running the trace to evaluate the performance influence after modifying the Components within the DRAM system 

# LLM trace generator
- The python script is the consecutive LLM trace generator provided by 張添烜's Lab member during the project, run it for traces generation for ramulator2

# How to Conduct Research
- Strongly suggest finishing the courses provided by Professor Onur Mutlu [Computer Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziMRjDlLEwo&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi-LfDdGgWyLcTSqzm6a26wD) to gain insight and ideas about how to do research in DRAM system analysis.

# Contact
